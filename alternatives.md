# Alternatives

Though this library was developed independently, several other
libraries were reviewed in the course of development, mostly to make
sure I'd stolen all the best ideas and practices. Some of these may be
a better fit for your purposes. 

* `pypassage` (https://github.com/col16/pypassage.git)
* `bible3` (https://github.com/TomFaulkner/bible)
* `usfm2osis` (https://github.com/chrislit/usfm2osis) supports the OSIS and USFM
  standards.
