# Known Issues

## Verses

* There are NT verses that are commonly omitted in texts that are not
  based on Textus Receptus. This should be handled in len, range
  enumeration, etc. 

## reference/parse

* References to single-chapter books still need an explicit book (so
  "Jude 1:6" rather than "Jude 6")
